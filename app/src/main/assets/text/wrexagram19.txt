A Player with real game is COMING UP. Streets talking about this Player.

Shit's looking good here. Big Dogs and True Players are working together, rolling positive plays in the game. Getting over ain’t a question. It’s about to happen. But Player still has some hard work to put his shit over. And good times don’t last forever. He have to be ready for when shit flips.

Empire State Building stands way high up over New York streets. That's like a True Player who lives on a higher level than other brothers, since he has more knowledge and power. Like that building stand all night and day, True Player never gets tired of standing tall. And just like that building have room for all them motherfuckers who work there, True Player is down with everybody who comes his way. High rollers and simple brothers, too. That’s why he’s real.
