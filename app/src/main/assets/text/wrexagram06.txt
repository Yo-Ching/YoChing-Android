When True Player meets some Ill Brother who rolls deep, DRAMA happens. If Ill Brother has a head for the game and real sharp moves, that DRAMA will be serious.

DRAMA happens because people just do shit different. Some brothers roll West Side, other brothers roll East Side. When they meet, it's DRAMA. When Player feels right, but another brother thinks he’s wrong, that's DRAMA. If Player ain’t 100% together, static from that brother will shake him up. Streets feel that. People talk shit. Business falls off.
