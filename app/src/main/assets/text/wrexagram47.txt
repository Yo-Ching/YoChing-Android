Streets are thick with crab asses. Them motherfuckers lock down the game. True Players and real brothers got no moves. People who step up get PLAYED. 

Being PLAYED is the opposite of being paid. Nothing positive is happening for a brother. He’s being shut down left and right. When a True Player gets PLAYED, he stays positive, but don't talk much. Nobody listen to a motherfucker who's getting PLAYED, no matter how real he is.

Motherfuckers get PLAYED all the time. Fate, ill timing, and bad luck will fuck a brother, shit gone bad from ALL directions. Sometimes there ain’t nothing to do but feel the hit. What happens in the outside world ain’t something a brother can control. But a True Player has heart. He stays stronger inside than whatever happens outside. That lets him handle anything Fate throw his way.
