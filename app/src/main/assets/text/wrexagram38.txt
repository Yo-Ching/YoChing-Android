When motherfuckers see shit different they go UP IN YOUR FACE.

It ain’t time to roll on large plays when motherfuckers UP IN YOUR FACE. There’s too much drama. When shit's like that, True Player don't force his moves. He ain't rude, neither. That only brings more motherfuckers UP IN YOUR FACE. True Player limits himself to little plays. Makes minor adjustments in the operation to tighten shit up. He can still get over. Streets ain’t 100% fucked, like when it’s dark out. Sometimes there’s just drama UP IN YOUR FACE. After that's sorted out, brothers fall into place and move forward. People put paid.

Nobody likes to deal with brothers UP IN YOUR FACE. But differences are part of life. Difference defines life. Uptown brothers normally don’t roll with downtown brothers. But in certain situations, a Player have to throw in with motherfuckers from outside his area. Whoever he’s dealing with, Player stays real. He can handle ignorant bust ass motherfuckers, ill brothers, party people, crab asses, Big Dogs, ordinary brothers, shorties, whatever. True Player works with anybody, and never lose his essence.
