When a brother is up in some high office building LOOKING OUT, he sees real far. When he's far away from that building, he can find it just by LOOKING OUT from them streets.

Heaven got laws. Sun rise and fall. Planets moving on point. If a brother thinks on them laws till he understand, he rolls deep and moves people. But brothers who want to be down with this level of reality have learning to do. Have to be respectful, too. A brother have to clean up before he shows up. Get his life together. Follow them rules and laws without missing nothing. Focus like a motherfucker.

When the wind blows through the park, grass have no choice but to bend. True Players change people just by passing through. Like grass blown by the wind. People have no choice but to be moved by a brother that large.
