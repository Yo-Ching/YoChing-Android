When True Player Bring It, WITH IT is down. A brother shouldn’t try to bring it when he’s WITH IT. 

WITH IT rolls low key. He’s down with brothers and them streets. People respect. If WITH IT busts off on his own shit, he falls off. But if he rolls with how shit is shaking out, he finds himself in the flow. WITH IT handles VIP scenarios smooth. But also feels them streets. Nobody ever talk shit about this brother. True Player never BRING IT without a brother who’s WITH IT.
