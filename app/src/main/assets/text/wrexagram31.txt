This is about men and women FEELING IT for each other. Brother got to take the first step. Lady lets him know if she’s FEELING IT. Once he's in, Player have to hold on even when he’s FEELING IT real nice. Make sure the female gets over first. That’s how a True Player hits it.

FEELING IT goes beyond just knocking boots. When a True Player steps into the game, people FEELING IT. Player moves real, plays smart, and rolls crisp. That shit affects brothers. When he’s running plays, True Player don't just tell motherfuckers "Do this, do that." He has real words, deep reasons, hard facts, and heart. He makes sure brothers FEELING IT. That way they throw in 100%.

Sometimes Player out in them streets just kicking it with motherfuckers, talking shit. Somebody hands Player a brew. Since he was out there FEELING IT with people, Player got that free brew. Another brother bring up some shit happen in business. Player picks up some helpful information. That wouldn’t happen if he was pulling back from brothers, off on his own shit.
