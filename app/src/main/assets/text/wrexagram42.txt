Shit works right when players high up the chain break off real pieces for brothers below. When the whole crew gets a BUMP UP in status, everybody should be paid out nice.

When a True Player high up in the game breaks off real pieces for his people, that’s a good look. Brothers have love for a player like that. If he puts them paid nice, and sets them up with real business angles, they down for whatever. Handle real dangerous shit. Roll on motherfuckers cross town, no problem. A Player uses good times to strengthen the crew. Paying people right shows respect. Respect builds loyalty. Good times don’t last forever, so a True Player makes the most of that shit.

Wind blowing is one thing. Thunder is another. But when Thunder and Wind both hit at the same time, shit is deep. Both BUMP UP the power of the other, make it more hardcore when they working together.
