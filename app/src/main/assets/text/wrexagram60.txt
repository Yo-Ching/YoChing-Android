Large parks have lakes in them. Lakes have LIMITS. If water goes past the LIMITS, water overflows. Fucks up the park.

Brothers need LIMITS in life. Lot of motherfuckers don’t like LIMITS. But that shit is necessary. True Player LIMITS himself mentally. He’s real about his abilities and the reality of other brothers. He knows the LIMITS of loyalty. True Player understands the LIMITS of being chill. He knows when to be low key about shit, and when a motherfucker has to break it down. He puts LIMITS on spending so money is there for hard times. He LIMITS his game to plays that can be managed well.

True Player ain't no motherfucker all over the place trying to be everything. Nobody like LIMITS, but they help.
