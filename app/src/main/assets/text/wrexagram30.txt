Fire is real powerful, but never works alone. Shit has to be sparked before fire can light up and SHINE.

Lot of normal motherfuckers will hold on tight to a famous brother when he becomes a star. Hang on to that brother for life. All them bullshit motherfuckers make a famous Player look even brighter. But stars needs something inside that maintains, or else they burn out. Everybody who SHINE have to hold onto something real inside them self and protect it. That way they stay shining. Sun and the moon hold tight to the sky. Trees and grass hold tight to the earth. Fame is a motherfucker. Mess a brother's head up for real. So famous Players who SHINE have to hold on tight to whatâ€™s right. That way they don't get lost. Helps them make positive shit happen for them streets.

Sun rise twice a day. After it goes down here, sun rise up the other side the planet. Sun ain't ever stop shining. True Player just like that. SHINE on and on.
