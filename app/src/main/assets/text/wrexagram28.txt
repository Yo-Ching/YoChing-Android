When a brother’s under mad PRESSURE, the situation has to be changed fast or real bullshit will happen.

When the roof is on fire, whole place about to burn down. That’s a fucked up and highly dangerous situation. Only real serious moves will set shit straight. Ain't no seed in the ground shit here, yo. Motherfucking roof on fire. Brothers have to move fast and take action. But they can’t panic like a bunch of bitches. Thinking in the middle of all that PRESSURE ain’t easy. Takes a True Player to stay cool when the motherfucking roof is on fire.

PRESSURE situations are like when New Orleans flooded. TV showed brothers in boats, rolling with shotguns, sleeping in a motherfucking stadium. Shit eventually cleared up. It was temporary. But that temporary situation was still very much fucked up. That’s PRESSURE. Temporary shit that is ill, and real hardcore.
