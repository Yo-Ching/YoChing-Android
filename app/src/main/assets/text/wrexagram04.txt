  SHORTY all over the neighborhood running wild, doing whatever. Young ones don’t know better. Little SHORTY got no game.
  
  Being dumb ain’t a crime for little ones. SHORTY will get it together if grown folks show the way. But Player don't chase after SHORTY trying to set him straight. Only when SHORTY ready to be respectful and pull his own weight can Player break it down. Knowledge flows from Player and just fills Shorty up. Happens natural, like water flowing in streams upstate.
