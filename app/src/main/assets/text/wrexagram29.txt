ILL SHIT is a fucked situation that a brother have to deal with. Like a bad job brother have to hold onto in lean times. Or a fucked neighborhood he ainâ€™t have the money to pull up out of. But if a brother rolls right, he pulls through that ILL SHIT. No problem.

ILL SHIT that just goes on and on makes a brother used to dealing with it. Brother in ILL SHIT should be like water in the river. Water in the river just flows through everything. It don't stop and try to hide from deep places. Water don't stress if shit is shallow neither. Water just fill up every place it have to. Don't miss nothing. Don't stop flowing. Water see a cliff, it jump right off like a motherfucking waterfall. Through all that, it don't change none, neither. Water stays water. And it never stops moving forward.

Player handles ILL SHIT the same way. Not scared of nothing, staying true to himself, and moving forward, whatever happens.
