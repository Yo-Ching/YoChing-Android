Shit's FALLING APART because ill brothers, crab asses, bad luck and trouble all working on a situation. This happens real slow, piece by motherfucking piece. So quiet nobody notice. Situation just FALLING APART, like some old house with a roof that's rotting.

Crab asses are running streets. Pushing their bullshit and getting over. Real brothers and True Players don't have power now. That ainâ€™t because they fucked up. It's just time for crab asses to have their minute. Shit runs in cycles.
