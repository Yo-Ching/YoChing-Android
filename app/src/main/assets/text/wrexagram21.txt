Player taking care of business with force. When ill brothers messing with his game, or crab asses talking shit, Player BREAK IT DOWN. Like lightning and thunder.

When plays ain't coming together due to bullshit from third parties, BREAK IT DOWN. Maybe motherfuckers won't throw in with Player because some crab ass out there telling lies. Or maybe some ill brothers running sideways game, playing him behind the scenes. Unless Player want shit to be permanently fucked, he have to step up and BREAK IT DOWN.

A Player don't BREAK IT DOWN on everything. And he don’t BREAK IT DOWN the same way in every situation. There are different responses to the variety of bullshit a crab ass will pull. When Player BREAK IT DOWN, he have to be like lightning. Clear and sharp. People respect the brother who is fair. But he have to be hard, too. Thunder makes people scared. People don’t fuck with the brother they scared of.
