True Player pulls brothers in, and BRING IT TOGETHER. Makes that shit happen.

If True Player puts his shit correct with The Heavens, all his plays have more weight. Shit leans his way. His people put paid. But when a whole lot of brothers throw in for a play, all them heads are thinking different ways. There’s drama and fights. And wherever real money stacks up, real criminals show up trying to take it. So when it’s time to BRING IT TOGETHER, True Player have to be ready for shit he ain’t ever thought of. Most problems are made by shit a brother never imagined, happening when he isn’t ready. If a Player is ready all the time for whatever, he rarely have problems.
