Sometimes a married brother sets up a SLIM THING and hits that shit on the side. Relations that ain't formal still have rules. 

SLIM THING down with a married brother have to know what’s up. She ain’t the main female here, and have to respect her place. If a SLIM THING wants her own man, she have to find some brother who ain’t married. But if she like them older married brothers who take care her right, baby girl have to be real with the set up. She ain’t the main female here. Just ass on the side.

Same thing true for all relationships that ain’t formal. When shit ain’t written down and a brother ain’t on paper with people, he best chill. If he putting in work for brothers who ain’t pulled him in 100%, he have to maintain low key. He ain’t really in. Just being used. That ain’t always a problem. This type of set up puts some dollars in a brother’s pocket. Help him make connects. Maybe develop into real business down the line. But right now, he don't have shit to say about the operation. He’s just some brother on the side.
