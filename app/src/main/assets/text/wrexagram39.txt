Player here have his back to the wall, with nothing but SOME BULLSHIT in front of him.

Life shakes out like that sometimes. But every bad situation has a way out. Player here facing SOME BULLSHIT that can't be handled direct. When it's like that, the smart play is to pull back. That don't mean running away. It means thinking shit through, putting a play together, and building up strength to make it through SOME BULLSHIT.

SOME BULLSHIT makes a brother face himself. When bad times roll up, friends fly away. Itâ€™s just Player and the game. Crab asses bitch about this. They say people are bad, blame problems on other brothers, hate on the game, whatever. True Player checks himself, first. He looks into his heart and mind. Finds whatever problems there he can fix. That's how he uses SOME BULLSHIT to make himself stronger, smarter, and better.
