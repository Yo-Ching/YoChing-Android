Bullshit brother in a powerful position is a bad look. When a motherfucker who don’t know shit is running things, True Players don’t try large moves. Just runs LITTLE PLAYS. 

Low key brothers are always appreciated. But nobody likes a bitch. True Player maintains respect. Sometimes he rolls real low key. Other times he bring it up a notch. Make motherfuckers feel his weight. But when it’s time for LITTLE PLAYS, large moves don’t fly. Ain't the time to shoot for them motherfucking stars. Player just maintain his place.
