Everybody trying to get over. But nobody knows when that shit will happen. Streets decide what’s good and when.
True Player is down with that. He stays CHILL.

CHILL don’t mean laying back and fucking off. It means maintaining even when there’s no love in the game for a brother. The CHILL Player never hopes his shit will get over. He knows it will. He just don’t know when. True Player maintains his angles. Plays his game. But he don't stress about his motherfucking train coming in. That lets him relax and CHILL. Share a brew with his people. Talk some bullshit. His train pulls in when it does.
