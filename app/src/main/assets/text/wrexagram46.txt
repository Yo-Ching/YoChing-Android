A player from them streets put his game together, made it tight, rolled right, and now he’s GETTING OVER for real. His shit is popping off. But Player ain’t GETTING OVER by being a motherfucker. He stays low key real, flowing through whatever's out there. He's feeling the times. His style matches what’s hitting on them streets.

Trees in the park start in the ground. Just some seed sending out roots. Them roots wind up through the dirt to find the sun. If they hit rocks blocking them, roots don’t stop. Just work around that shit. Roots don’t rush and don’t stagnate. They just push it along. Nobody sees motherfucking roots on the move. But that’s all they're doing, real slow and low key. Same thing with True Player who’s GETTING OVER from the streets. He’s always moving forward. But he’s chill about it. Never rushing, never stagnating, just pushing shit along, bit by bit, till one day he’s GETTING OVER. Then everybody see how large he is. Like some motherfucking tree in the park.
