Player is TAKING CARE of himself and his people with the right food for body, mind, and soul.

Eating right is important. That fast food is murder for a brother. Motherfuckers make them damn cheese burgers out of the worst parts the animal. Soda is poison too. Makes a brother fat and stupid. Brother who wants to be a True Player always TAKING CARE his body right.

Springtime bring thundershowers. Makes the grass and flowers grow. Happens because them seeds in the ground stayed chill. When the rain fall, their shit ready to grow. That's the look for TAKING CARE. Chill before the movement. True Player follows that look to take care his self and be ready.
