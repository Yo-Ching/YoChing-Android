Ain’t nothing worse than a bust ass WATER FOUNTAIN at the park. If shit's rusty or fucked up, nobody can drink from it. But if that WATER FOUNTAIN is maintained, there’s water for everybody. 

Same thing with a brother’s life. He have to maintain himself and stay useful. If he lets himself go, people won’t have no use for him. If brothers live deep, like water far down in the earth, they have a real life. Problems happen when motherfuckers live shallow, and don’t lower the bucket into what’s real and deep in the world. Or they don’t maintain themselves.

WATER FOUNTAIN has different parts that work together. Press that button, water’s there. A crew is the same way. True Player helps brothers work together. He organize them right, makes sure they tight. When different parts of the organization are working right, shit just flows. Press a button, it’s on.
