True Player is STAYING CHILL when it’s time to chill. Move when it’s time to move. Brother like that rolling with the rhythm of things.

When Player STAYING CHILL on deep levels, his mind and heart turn real calm. He sees shit clear. That helps him move right. True Players meditate. Ain’t have to be no monk for that shit. Just sit there breathing, stare at the motherfucking wall. Do it right, the whole world chill out. Drama just disappear a minute. Players STAYING CHILL at a deep level like that tune into rhythm of things. Make the right moves, at the right time. Ain’t ever roll on bust ass plays.

Crab ass have his head all over the place. Tripping on shit downtown, while handling business uptown. Stresses on shit from last week, while dropping the ball today. True Player have his head where he’s at. That's STAYING CHILL.
