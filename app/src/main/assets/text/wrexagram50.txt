THE POT is on the stove. People make meals and feed themselves with THE POT. It's about nourishment.

Water Fountain is about water. Every motherfucker need water. People need food, too. But food is different from water. Water is natural. Just flow right up out the ground. Food have to be prepared. Animals eat their shit raw. People more advanced. Put food in THE POT, follow recipes, serve that shit up in homes. THE POT is about motherfucking civilization.

People put THE POT on the stove to heat up food. Power beneath THE POT heats it up. Life has power that heats up a brother’s life, too. If a brother puts his life in order, that power starts to heat up his moves. He starts rolling with forces other motherfuckers don’t have access too. That power changes his game and makes him a True Player. Brothers who don’t live right never feel that power. Them motherfuckers stay cold.
