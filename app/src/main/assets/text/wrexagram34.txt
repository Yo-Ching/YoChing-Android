Brother rolling with strength has REAL POWER.

Player's status been building for a long time. He maintained, did shit right, ran plays crisp, listened to The Heavens,
watched them streets, and now he have REAL POWER. That's a good look. The only way shit might turn left is if Player forgets what's right. He's rolling large now, and quite frankly, a brother with REAL POWER does whatever the fuck he wants to do. Brothers with this much weight naturally wants to flex that shit. That’s a problem if Player don't remember his place. He’s large, but The Heavens are larger. Player have to respect that.

Thunder is up in the sky. That’s how it stays powerful. Thunder don’t run around in them streets. Thunder don’t jump in the ocean, and try to roll there.  Since Heaven put Thunder in the damn sky, that’s where Thunder rolls. It follows the laws of Heaven. Thunder stays mad powerful that way. REAL POWER depends on being in the right place, and rolling the right way. Thats why True Player with REAL POWER don’t fuck around with bullshit brothers. He ain't roll with ill brothers and crab asses. He ain’t roll with situations that ain’t down with The Law of Heaven. True Player respect The Heavens and watch them streets. Holds onto REAL POWER that way.
