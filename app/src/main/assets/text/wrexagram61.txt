A brother with heart is FOR REAL. He treats people lower down the chain right. He's solid with players high up the chain, too. Does what True Player says and handles shit right. People feel that. Say the brother's FOR REAL.

Animals don’t understand words. But they understand what motherfuckers be about. Animals feel shit. Brothers who ain’t smart, brothers who ain’t right, and brothers real rough feel shit out like animals. They ain’t use their head to listen to a player. Just feel from the heart. Motherfuckers like this see through all the fronting. They don’t fall for bullshit. Just know who’s FOR REAL. 

If a Player want to lean this type of brother his way, he can’t run game, talk nice, or bust out business plans. Just step up FOR REAL.
