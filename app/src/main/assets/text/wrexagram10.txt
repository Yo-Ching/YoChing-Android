When heavy players and ordinary brothers mix up, shit's slippery. For brothers who ain’t The Big Dog, WATCH YOUR STEP.

Sometimes Player have to deal with real wild, ill brothers. Player can manage the situation by maintaining a respectful style of handling shit. Good manners get over even with real fucked up people. Motherfuckers have a place they should be in this world. Just like nature. Heaven is naturally high. Streets are naturally low.

They ain't have no beef with each other. Streets ain’t looking up at Heaven thinking: "Damn, I wish my shit was up there." Heaven don’t look down saying: "Shit, I wish I rolled like Streets." Heaven is good with being Heaven. Streets is down with being Streets. Both belong where they are. That’s their motherfucking nature, yo. True Player knows his nature, He stays good with who he is and where he's rolling.
