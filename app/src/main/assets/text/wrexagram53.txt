To PUSH IT ALONG in the game, a brother have to be mentally chill. That way he don’t stress situations or roll on stupid shit. His plays are smart and small. Little bit here, little bit there, he PUSH IT ALONG. Player like this grows slow, but he grows real strong. One day, he’s so large that motherfuckers don’t even think of stepping to him.

Motherfuckers who rush their business always get played. True Player lets situations develop. He PUSH IT ALONG, but don’t force nothing. Large plays have their own timetable. True Players respect that. A True Player who PUSH IT ALONG is like tree roots. Roots are always working, growing, and taking more ground. But they do it real slow. Nothing stop them motherfuckers. Roots hit a wall, they work around that shit. Roots hit a rock, they push that shit away, real slow.

But PUSH IT ALONG is a tough angle to maintain. Brothers feel like nothing’s happening. So they fall off. It’s hard to stay with shit day after day, bit by bit, and just PUSH IT ALONG.
