Brothers THROW SHIT OFF when it ain’t working. This should only happen in dangerous situations, with no other way out.

Not just any motherfucker can THROW SHIT OFF. A True Player who everybody trusts and believe in have to lead. Timing has to be right on. If Player rolls too early, people aren’t ready to THROW SHIT OFF yet. If he rolls too late, the bullshit is too thick and people are trapped.

Player have to THROW SHIT OFF right. He can’t roll hard. He don’t roll wild style. THROW SHIT OFF ain’t about pouring gasoline on motherfuckers and lighting them on fire. True Player have to maintain positivity and handle his people. And Player have to be thinking of everybody, not just himself. Some motherfuckers THROW SHIT OFF just to set themselves up in the new situation. That’s bullshit. True Player leads motherfucker to THROW SHIT OFF because it’s the right thing to do. Not because he wants to run shit.
