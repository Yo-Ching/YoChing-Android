When it's DARK OUT, streets real dangerous. Brothers get shot.

Player has to hold himself together when it's DARK OUT. He can't throw in with the ill shit that's running streets. He can't let it break his spirit, neither. When it’s DARK OUT, Player maintains his own light. Holds onto that spark inside himself.

Being hard don’t help when it’s DARK OUT. Player should roll chill and be an easy brother. Not stressing situations. Not stepping to ill brothers. That mindset helps a Player survive when it's DARK OUT. Player stays laid back. Never rude or up in nobody's face. That keeps him from being hated on. When it’s DARK OUT, lots of brothers roll ill and live bad lifestyles. True Player don’t throw in with them. Same time, he don’t judge them motherfuckers or drag their shit into the light. He just plays dumb. Looks like some pointless motherfucker who don't know shit. He lets things slide as much as possible, without being played. That's how True Players and real brothers survive when it’s DARK OUT.
