This is when shit starts changing from being fucked up to running right. Like when springtime RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. Flowers ain’t out yet, but that motherfucking winter is ending. Even before it happens, streets feeling better. That’s a good look to finish YO CHING.

This is a large job with major responsibilities. It’s about leading streets out of bullshit. Since this job is so important, Player have to be real careful at the jump. Like an old man crossing the street uptown.

Old man crossing the street is legendary shit uptown. They choose real careful when they pick the corner to cross from. Look both ways about fifty times. Only then they roll. Streets ain’t no joke for them old motherfuckers. 

When good shit’s RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, being slow and real careful sets a brother up to be paid.
