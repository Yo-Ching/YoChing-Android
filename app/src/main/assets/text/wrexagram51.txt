BOOM is powerful, shocking shit. Like thunder or shots fired. Scare the hell out of every motherfucker around. But some shit that happen without a sound still BOOM. Like when real fucked up information brought to light. That hits brothers like: BOOM.

When a True Player deals with danger for a long time, he learns to handle fear. He feels fear but faces it down. Then nothing scare him no more. Player like that is chill about his life. He don’t want to die, but he ain’t afraid to check out. So BOOM don’t bother him none. Other motherfuckers run and hide when BOOM hit. Scared as hell. True Player pour tea in the middle of a damn earth quake. Not spilling a drop. That’s the look for True Player. Shit motherfuckers run from bounce right off him.

True Player is down with whatever shakes out. Heavens do what they do. Respect like this leads to good things.
