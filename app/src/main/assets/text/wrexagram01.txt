With that force behind his moves, True Player don't miss a beat. True Players organize motherfuckers and set them rolling on plays. Put people paid. Living crisp helps True Player focus. He ainâ€™t some motherfucker trying to be everything. True Player puts limits on himself. Picks his plays, chooses his angles, runs them right. All other shit he just let go. Focus like that makes him real powerful.
