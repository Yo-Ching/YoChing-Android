Brother here is moving out of some bullshit. He ain’t 100% BAILED OUT from the problem, but shit is turning around.

When bullshit and static are clearing up, a brother should return to business as usual, fast as possible. When shit changes for the better, streets are feeling positive. People all down with each other. Player takes advantage of this time and sets things rolling. But he don't overdo that shit. It would be a bad look to move on large plays. After some bullshit, just returning things to normal is enough. If there's still some static in the air, Player clears it fast. He cleans house 100%. That way the crew don’t slide back into some bullshit down the line. 

Thunderstorms clear the air. True Player handles brothers who fuck up the same way. He is real clear, like that crack of thunder. Lets motherfuckers who slipped know what time it is. But he don’t trip out on shit forever. He lets it go. Comes down loud and clear, but lets shit fade away like thunder. True Player forgives his people. He understands they ain’t on his level. People fuck up. Brothers drop the ball and make wrong moves. Player gets mad, but then forgives that shit. Like rain wash them streets clean.
