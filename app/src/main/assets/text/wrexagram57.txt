The LIGHT TOUCH works without being seen. Ain’t no secret shit, just real low key. It don’t stop working on a situation. Brothers who get over with a LIGHT TOUCH ain’t dramatic. They don’t blow right the fuck up out of nowhere. But they last longer, since their game been building forever.

A brother rolling with the LIGHT TOUCH needs clear goals. Since his game moves slow, it’s easy to lose direction. Or just fall off. LIGHT TOUCH is a good look for brothers who ain’t have much weight in the game. But it only really works if they down with some hard motherfucker who rolls deep. Always be situations where a brother have to break it down. LIGHT TOUCH don’t do that.
