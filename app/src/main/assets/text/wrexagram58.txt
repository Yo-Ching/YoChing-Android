Sometimes a motherfucker just HAPPY. That’s best handled low key. A brother should maintain his heart steady on the inside, and be chill on the outside when he’s HAPPY.

When Player's real HAPPY, his people feel that. Then they HAPPY. That’s a good look. Business rolls well for HAPPY motherfuckers. Ain’t nobody hand their money to brothers looking like they lost their teddy bear. But HAPPY brothers have to maintain. Otherwise them feelings bust out into party bullshit. Operations lose focus when people run around popping champagne.

When a True Player is real HAPPY, he holds his heart steady. Heavens love a Player who maintains himself level. Steady in the bad, steady in the good. Brothers feel that shit, too. Have respect and put in work for Player.
