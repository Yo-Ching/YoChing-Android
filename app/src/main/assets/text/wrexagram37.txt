Strong leadership comes from the head of the FAMILY. Strong families make a strong world.

Fire makes heat. Heat is power. Thatâ€™s the look of FAMILY. If a father wants to handle his children right, he should have power. Like a fire inside. If a Player wants his words to have power, he needs something real inside his words. Like wood inside a fire. Fire only has heat if there's wood to burn. Words only have power if they relate to what's happening. Motherfuckers who talk shit about whatever comes to mind lose power. Words should be focused on what's happening in the moment. But if a brother don't step correct, whatever he say don't mean shit. A Player who wants people listening to what he says have to watch how he walks.
