PEACE is motherfuckers working together right with everybody paid nice.

PEACE is like heaven in the streets. Big Dogs are looking out for their people. All beefs are settled. True Players are running things. Organizations flowing smooth. Like sun on them streets, PEACE is real nice. Shit stays this way if Big Dog breaks off pieces for his people, settles beefs right, and lets money flow. Otherwise, PEACE is just a nice run that craps out.
