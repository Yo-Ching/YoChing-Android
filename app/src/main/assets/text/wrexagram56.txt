BOUNCING brother rolls wherever he want. Pass through places he ain’t have people.

BOUNCING brother can’t front and be hard. He don’t sweat motherfuckers, neither. Since a BOUNCING brother all alone, he just rolls chill and low key. Lives correct, so he don’t bring drama into his life. Can’t roll with sketchy brothers or party sisters. BOUNCING brother don’t know the players or the game where he land. So he lives life clean. That helps him stay out of drama.

When a BOUNCING brother land in new places, he don’t know how the game run. He might break some laws he ain’t familiar with. Or cross some motherfuckers he don’t know about. If shit flips legal, BOUNCING brother should try and pass through the system fast as possible. It ain’t about being right. It’s about being smart. A brother with no people and no connects, who fights motherfuckers in their own court is done. Then he’s caught in the system. Prison ain’t no place a brother want to be.
