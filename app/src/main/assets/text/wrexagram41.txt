Business slows and a brother’s action cools. He starts LOSING WEIGHT. Money flies away, properties fall off. If a brother plays it right, he survive this shit, no problem.

LOSING WEIGHT is part of business. Shit moves in cycles.  A Player feels them and changes his game. When he’s LOSING WEIGHT he don’t maintain like money’s moving. Some brothers borrow. Try to keep up appearances. Then they owe motherfuckers. That’s bullshit. When a True Player start LOSING WEIGHT, he rolls with it. Makes lean stretches of the game work for him. Trims fat, sheds unnecessary motherfuckers and dials the operation down tight. Finds focus and builds strength.

A brother on top ain’t have trouble feeling good about himself. He’s rolling in style and motherfuckers all want a piece. When shit turns left, all that falls off. People think he’s bullshit. Streets show no love. Now that brother have to find love and respect in his heart. Build positivity from the inside. Heavens always down with a brother like that. If he’s holding property or LOSING WEIGHT, the brother who stays respectful in his heart gets Heaven leaning his way.
