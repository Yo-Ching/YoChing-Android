Some bust ass basketball courts have grass growing right up through the pavement. Shit wasn't easy for that grass. Started out all alone in the dark. Then it hit the damn concrete. But that grass maintained till it got over into the light. That’s STRESS GETTING STARTED.

Before shit pops off, it has to come together. That’s a hard time. Brothers get frustrated. Some put plays in motion just to have business on them streets. True Player ain’t with that. He know that rolling before shit comes together turns into plays that fall apart. During STRESS GETTING STARTED, True Player pulls brothers together and maintains order.
