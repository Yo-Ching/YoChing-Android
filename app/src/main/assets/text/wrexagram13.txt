When serious brothers GETTING TOGETHER, nobody backs down. That leads to drama. But if one brother don’t mind rolling diplomatic for the whole crew, GETTING TOGETHER works out. GETTING TOGETHER leads to real shit if brothers think past their own personal interest. Positive things happen when brothers think long game for the whole crew, and what's good for them streets. Stars are different from the sky, but they up in it. Stars been organized by brothers and given names.

Back in the day that’s how motherfuckers got around. Just looked up at the stars like GPS. Took real thoughtful brothers to organize motherfucking stars in the sky. True Player have to organize brothers GETTING TOGETHER the same way. Real thoughtful.
