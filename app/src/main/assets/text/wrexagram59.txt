When pressure make a brother tense, and he don’t have no outlet, he have to BREAK IT UP. He do this with a light touch. BREAK IT UP ain’t about smashing shit apart.

This Wrexagram looks like Bring It Together, where True Player bringing together all the brothers and making the crew. But BREAK IT UP happens when the crew already been put together. There’s static from egos here. Every motherfucker feel he’s the smart one. Player have to step in and BREAK IT UP. But only a True Player with the best interests of the whole organization can BREAK IT UP right.

Player don’t do shit for his own advantage. He wants what’s best for every motherfucker. If he run shit fair, and do shit right, Player will BREAK IT UP correct. That stops the ego tripping, and keeps motherfuckers from drifting in different directions. Crew stays tight that way.
