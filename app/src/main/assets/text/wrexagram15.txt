Foolish motherfuckers flash and flaunt. Heaven loves LOW KEY.

The game moves in cycles. Same law running The Heavens runs them streets. Sun up in the sky have nowhere to go but down. The sun never hits high noon and says: “Fuck this, yo, I’m rolling higher.” Laws of Heaven run that motherfucker. Brothers think they different but they ain’t. If a brother is too high up, Heavens going to bring him down.

When we was shorties, Michael Jordan blew our mind. What he did with that ball was motherfucking magic. Watch him play like: "Oh, shit! He did what?" But MJ made it all look natural. Just moved like nothing at all. Same with Tiger Woods on that golf course. Ain’t nobody watched Tiger saying: "Damn, golf looks hard." Both them players just made shit look real easy.

True Player same way. Maintains that LOW KEY touch.
