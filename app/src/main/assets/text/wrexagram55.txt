Ain’t just any motherfuckers who pop off LEGENDARY shit. Starts with a True Player backed by a righteous Big Dog. Player views life real large. Sees shit other motherfuckers ain’t have the power to think of. True Player bring them pictures to life. Has the moves to pull it off. Has a tight crew and they throw in 100%. When Big Dog puts the weight behind them motherfuckers, shit gets LEGENDARY.

Runs like this are real special. They don't last too long. Player might trip on that. But whatever's next don’t matter. When shit gets LEGENDARY, it's time to shine.

A crew only gets LEGENDARY when their shit been running for some time. Them motherfuckers established. Rules are clear. Every brother know what’s right and wrong. In established organizations, rules are like thunder rolling around. Reminds motherfuckers lighting will come down if they fuck with shit. If brothers hear that thunder and still decide to step out of line, True Player breaks it down fierce. Hits like lightning. Real shocking shit. Makes it clear to motherfuckers what happens if they don’t mind the damn thunder.
